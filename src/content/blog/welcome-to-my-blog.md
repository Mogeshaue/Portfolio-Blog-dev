## Welcome! 👋

I'm excited to share my journey in cybersecurity with you. This blog will be a space where I document my findings, techniques, and lessons learned from:

- **Web Application Security** - Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web apps
- **Mobile Security** - Android reversing, Frida hooking, and IPC exploitation
- **CTF Writeups** - Solutions to interesting challenges
- **Security Research** - Deep dives into specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing:
- Detailed writeups of bugs I've found
- Step-by-step guides for security tools
- Analysis of interesting vulnerabilities
- Tips and tricks I've learned along the way

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon! Follow along as I break things, learn from them, and share what I discover.

Happy hacking! 🔐
